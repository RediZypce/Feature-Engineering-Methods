# Feature Engineering Methods in Machine Learning

Welcome to the __"Feature Engineering Methods"__ repository, where we explore and demonstrate essential techniques for optimizing datasets before applying machine learning models. This repository combines two projects: "Filter Methods" and "Wrapper Methods," both created using Jupyter Notebooks, to provide a comprehensive overview of feature engineering.

## Project Overview

### Filter Methods 
[Jupyter Notebook](Filter_Methods.ipynb)
- **Description:** The "Filter Methods" project focuses on techniques for feature selection that filter out irrelevant or redundant features before model training.
- **Contents:** This project includes Jupyter Notebook(s) that cover variance threshold, Pearson's correlation, correlation with the target variable, correlation between features, and mutual information.

### Wrapper Methods
[Jupyter Notebook](Wrapper_Methods.ipynb)
- **Description:** The "Wrapper Methods" project delves into algorithms that select features by evaluating model performance on different subsets of features, adding or removing features one at a time based on their usefulness.
- **Contents:** This project includes Jupyter Notebook(s) detailing Sequential Forward Selection, Sequential Backward Selection, Sequential Forward Floating Selection, Sequential Backward Floating Selection, and Recursive Feature Elimination.
