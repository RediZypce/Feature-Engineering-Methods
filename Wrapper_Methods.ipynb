    "# Summary:\n",
    "In this Jupyter Notebook project, we will delve into the world of feature engineering, with a specific focus on wrapper methods for feature selection. Wrapper methods are a family of algorithms that select features by systematically evaluating a machine learning model's performance on different subsets of features. Unlike filter methods, wrapper methods assess features based on their performance with a specific model, providing a more tailored approach to feature selection. We will explore and implement five distinct wrapper methods to optimize feature selection for improved model performance."

    "* __Iteration 1:__\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm begins with the best-performing single feature (e.g., \"Glucose\" if it offers the best performance). It then tests the model's performance using various combinations of the next feature to add, such as {Glucose, BMI}, {Glucose, HOMA}, and so on.\n",
    "* __Iteration 2:__\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature that enhances the model the most is added to the subset. For example, if {Glucose, BMI} performs best, the algorithm proceeds to the next iteration by considering the remaining features with this subset: {Glucose, BMI, Insulin}, {Glucose, BMI, Leptin}, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Iteration 3:__\n",

    "Sequential Forward Selection is a greedy algorithm. Instead of examining all possible feature subsets exhaustively, it selects the feature that offers the best immediate performance gain at each step. This approach helps identify a subset of features that work well together for your specific modeling task and dataset, potentially enhancing model accuracy and efficiency."
